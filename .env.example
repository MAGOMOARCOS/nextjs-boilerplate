# Environment variables (example)
# Note: Do NOT prefix the service role key with NEXT_PUBLIC_. Keep the service role key server-only.

# Client-safe keys (exposed to client)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=sb_publishable_xxx

# Server-only keys (DO NOT expose to client; do not use NEXT_PUBLIC_)
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=sb_secret_xxx   # MUST be the service role (sb_secret_*). This is required by app/lib/supabaseServer.ts

# Notes:
# - On Vercel, there is no separate "server-only" checkbox. To keep a secret server-only:
#   * Do NOT use NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix.
#   * Only reference SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY from server-side code (e.g., in app/lib/supabaseServer.ts or server route handlers).
# - Make sure SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY is the secret service role (sb_secret_*). Using the publishable key (sb_publishable_*) will not allow server-side privileged operations and is a security risk if stored as a service role.
